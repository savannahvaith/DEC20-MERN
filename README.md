# Goal Tracking Project

This project will look at creating at tracking Goals for users to keep track of their milestones and achievements.

## Planning

Initially, a [wire frame](https://wireframe.cc/puD3sj) was created.
This outlines the different components that we could have when desgining the application.

## Running The Application

The backend is written in Express; and incorporates MongoDB.

To run the application, first clone down the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/savannahvaith/DEC20-MERN
```

First, you need to run the backend and ensure it has connected to mongo correctly.

To run the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The application will then be deployed on `http://localhost:5019/`

*Note, you only need to run `npm install` once to get the node modules pulled into your computer, for every subsequent deployment, simply skip this step*

The front-end of the application is written in React.

To run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The application will be deployed on `http://localhost:3000`

*Note, you only need to run `npm install` once to get the node modules pulled into your computer, for every subsequent deployment, simply skip this step*
